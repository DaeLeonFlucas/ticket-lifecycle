Using the accounts for Ken and Karen created in the prior osTicket lab, we will generate two separate tickets.
</p>
<p>
Users can select a Help Topic that best categorizes their issue or request. An Issue Summary is added to give a quick understanding of the ticket. Describe the issue in the textbox below, and attach any relevant files, such as screenshots, to support your request. Once all details are entered, click on Create Ticket to submit.

Here, you can see a completed ticket for ken, who has reported a Personal Computer Issue.

<h2>Assignment and Communication</h2>
<p>
By clicking on a ticket, you will access the ticket details, showing how they appear from jane doe’s perspective. As jane doe, you have the ability to modify various options associated with the ticket, such as Status, Priority, Department, Assigned To, and SLA plan. By selecting each of these fields, adjustments can be made based on the ticket’s priority or impact.

By using the available options, we can modify the ticket as required. All changes will be reflected in the ‘Ticket Thread’.

</p>
<p>
Agents can also send messages to the End User through the Ticket Thread to keep them and other Agents informed about the ticket’s progress. Furthermore, the Ticket’s Status can be modified at the bottom of the thread if the issue has been addressed.

<h2>Resolution</h2>
<p>
In response to the ongoing ticket issue, we have noted that our website is currently down. Given that this is a high-priority and high-impact ticket, it requires immediate attention. Once we find a solution, we can reply to inform the user and proceed to resolve and close the ticket.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Once open tickets are resolved, they transition to closed status and are moved to the ‘Closed Ticket’ queue, where their information and status are archived.
