Using the accounts for Ken and Karen created in the prior osTicket lab, we will generate two separate tickets.
</p>
<p>
Users can select a Help Topic that best categorizes their issue or request. An Issue Summary is added to give a quick understanding of the ticket. Describe the issue in the textbox below, and attach any relevant files, such as screenshots, to support your request. Once all details are entered, click on Create Ticket to submit.

Here, you can see a completed ticket for ken, who has reported a Personal Computer Issue.

</p>



<h2>Assignment and Communication</h2>
<p>
By clicking on a ticket, you will access the ticket details, showing how they appear from jane doe’s perspective. As jane doe, you have the ability to modify various options associated with the ticket, such as Status, Priority, Department, Assigned To, and SLA plan. By selecting each of these fields, adjustments can be made based on the ticket’s priority or impact.

Using the options above, we can adjust the ticket as needed. Any changes will be displayed in the 'Ticket Thread'.

</p>
<p>
The Agent can also message the End User through the Ticket Thread to update the User or other Agents about the status of the ticket. At the bottom, you can also adjust the Ticket's Status if the issues have been resolved.

<h2>Resolution</h2>
<p>
Continuing with the ticket's issue, we have left a response to the fact that our website is currently down. Since this is a high-priority and high-impact ticket, we must resolve it right away. Once a solution has been found we can post a reply to let the user know and finally resolve and close the ticket.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Any open tickets that are resolved become closed tickets and are then moved into the 'Closed Ticket' queue where the information and status of the ticket are archived.
